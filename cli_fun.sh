# The aim of this file was to learn a bit more about bash in the process of automating more of what I do from the CLI.

# URL redirect
#
# Say I want to open a particular website, Splunk for instance. I might want to open Splunk on my local, test or prod server
# it would be nice if I could type 's' then a particular query which would then redirect me in my browser to said URL.


# grep
#
# Quite simply, I see too many people around me using grep and I've really not spent any time learning how to use it minus
# the occassional command I'll copy and paste.
